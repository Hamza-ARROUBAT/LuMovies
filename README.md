<h1 align="center">Think-it Web Challenge - Junior <br/> (Lum Movies)</h1>

# Introduction

Hope you like it ! 😉👍🏼 <br/>
`Lum Movies` is a React SPA that enables the user to search for the top games by playtime or by number of unique users.
The application consists of two components:

- A backend that serves the data to the frontend
- A frontend that consumes the endpoints exposed by the backend and displays the data to the user.

To run the App on your machines 💻, just run on each folder (frontend/backend) `yarn install` and then `yarn start`, if you want to use npm, u can do so, just don't forget to remove `yarn.lock` files.

# Technologies

In this section i will explain why i chose each technology for this project.

## React

React is one of the most used Javascript libraries, it is considered as a Framework thanks to it's big ecosystem which makes it one of the best Frameworks for building SPA.

## axios

Axios is a Javascript library used to make requests and recieve responses. It supports the Promise API wich makes it really easy to use in comparison with native Http/XMLHttp requests.

## styled-components

styled-components allow to write CSS code to style for each component separatly or collectively. It uses SASS syntaxe which makes it really nice and easy to use.
One of the main reasons why i use this library is the fact that you can pass components props and use them in a styling code.

## styled-icons

An icon library that delivers SVG icons from different sources (material-icons, bootstrap, Font Awesome...) to use with React. And I prefer using it because of it's icons syntax that are made with styled components.

## Material-UI

Material-UI is a React component library that makes the development faster and easier with the pre-made components that we can just import and integrate in our Apps.

## Node.js

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
I really like Node.js and all of it's ecosystem libraries because it makes it very easy to build complex apps that normally should take double amount of effort with other frameworks.

## Express.js

It's a javascript framework that provides a lot of HTTP utility methods and middleware at our disposal, making building a robust API quick and easy.

## Lodash

it's a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for almost all common programming tasks.
It is also very efficient, so i tend to use it when i can.

## dotenv

Environment variables are always needed to make the code more maintainable and more secure, and are easy to set up with Dotenv which automatically loads environment variables from a .env file into the process.env object.

#### ---> A last word : This project was really exiting to make, i just wanted to say a biiig Thank you 🤗 to Think-it and it's recruitment team. Your breakthrough recruitment process will surely make you one of the best companies ✨.
